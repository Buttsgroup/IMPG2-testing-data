# IMPG2-testing-data
Dataset containing molecules used in assessing IMPG2 performance

Dataset3 originates from the IMPRESSION paper[1]
DFT8K_bg are structures directly sampled from CASCADE but recalculated using wB97XD to align with our DFT functional[2]
Holdout contains our withheld data during model training of IMPRESSION Generation 2
